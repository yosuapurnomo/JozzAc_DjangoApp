RUST - Ribo-seq Unit Step Transformation
========================================
This tool is designed for ribo-seq data and produces a metafootprint profile
that reveals the influence of mRNA features such as codons/amino acids on
the relative read density in the sample across the entire ribosome and nascent
peptide region. The Kullback-Leibler divergence across these sites is also provided.

An online version is available on `RiboGalaxy <http://ribogalaxy.ucc.ie>`_.
